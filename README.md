# cryptopals-solutions
Solutions to (some of) the cryptopals exercises. Originally, the solutions were not indended to be shared, but the NCC Group themselves [have tutorials out for them](https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/01/23/announcing-ncc-groups-cryptopals-guided-tour-set-2/) now, so I see no harm in publishing them here too.

Written in Rust as part of my learning experience with it. I may add more solutions at a later date, or clean up earlier ones.
